Error model under skeleton archers spawned with the book

=Missing just on clients=
Nothing? I don't seem to notice a difference now

GAMEPLAY ISSUES:
=Broken shit=
Spawn particle for spawners
Frozen explosion hits both
Assaulter is still too high range
Hurricaner the same, probably need removing as its too hard to understand where the area is and interacts badly with many units
Flash self-target error is not showing up
Knockback can push over the water and some cliffs, probably removing or reworking it
Nightmarish stacking might be a problem, reduce
Custom sounds are gone
Battledrums no aura indicator
DeathTimers are decreasing
Cyclone is a hideous spell, should remove it
