GAMEPLAY ISSUES:
=Broken shit=
Spawn particle for spawners
Frozen explosion hits both - Fixed
Assaulter is still too high range
Hurricaner the same, probably need removing as its too hard to understand where the area is and interacts badly with many units
Flash self-target error is not showing up
Knockback can push over the water and some cliffs, probably removing or reworking it - Improved the map skip blocks a bit, check if fixed on the water areas
	Still has problems.
Nightmarish stacking might be a problem, reduce
Custom sounds are gone
Battledrums no aura indicator
DeathTimers are decreasing
Cyclone is a hideous spell, should remove it
Sun Key is not very noticeable
Delay on endgame being instant
