	Seems fixed for the most part, mainly related to cosmetic particles of wearables
Blade Storm is black - This is also probably cosmetic related. Mine is ok
Whip is broken and does not alling with attacks - Probably another cosmetic related
Ice Armor misses particiles and produces red crosses - Fixed, needed full lich particles, it should work now.

GAMEPLAY ISSUES:
=Broken shit=
Spawn particle for spawners
Frozen explosion hits both - Fixed
Assaulter is still too high range
Hurricaner the same, probably need removing as its too hard to understand where the area is and interacts badly with many units
Flash self-target error is not showing up
Knockback can push over the water and some cliffs, probably removing or reworking it - Improved the map skip blocks a bit, check if fixed on the water areas
	Still has problems.
Nightmarish stacking might be a problem, reduce - Fixed
Custom sounds are gone
Battledrums no aura indicator
DeathTimers are decreasing
Cyclone is a hideous spell, should remove it
Sun Key is not very noticeable
Delay on endgame being instant
Nerf Techies PLEASE
Ults being channeled is kinda bad for higher difficulties as standing still is impossible
