GAMEPLAY ISSUES:
=Broken shit=

Frozen explosion hits both
Assaulter is still too high range
Hurricaner the same, probably need removing as its too hard to understand where the area is and interacts badly with many units

Knockback can push over the water and some cliffs, probably removing or reworking it
Nightmarish stacking might be a problem, reduce
Custom sounds are gone
Battledrums no aura indicator
