Version 1.2.0
	General
		Added Difficulty Levels - Each additional level of difficulty will add one affix to each different creature, from a big pool of custom abilities.
		Added Save Points - At certain key points in the map you will reach savepoints. Whenever you die you will be given the choice of resurrecting at the latest point and continue playing from there. 
		
		The new difficulty levels will increase the death toll by a lot, so we felt disabling respawn and ending the game when everyone dies was too harsh.
		Now you should always be able to finish the map in any difficulty no matter how many deaths it takes. However, we'll still track the deaths and difficulty stats, and the most successful parties will be rewarded in the next update which will bring Achievements & Scoreboard.
